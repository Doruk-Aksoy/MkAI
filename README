MkAI - A library for creating AI for Unity Games

MkAI uses deliberative coherence theory to create networks of goals and tasks.
The intended use is to create smart agents in games that use the network provided to them by the programmers.
Programmers can change and improve the network at will, for example to indicate outside events and their impacts.
The final goal is to have the library use Q-Learning method to discover weights of goals and tasks on its own.
